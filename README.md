**Project Abstract:** 
  In our day to day life emotions or facial expression are the prime factor which are required for communication purpose. For humans it is quite easy to detect an emotion but difficult for a computer or a machine to do so. 
  This project deals with three emotions they are Neutral, Happy and Sad. In this work, user’s emotion using its facial expressions will be detected. 
  These expressions can be derived from the live feed via system’s camera or any pre-existing image available in the memory. 
  Emotions possessed by humans can be recognized and has a vast scope of study in the computer vision industry upon which several researches have already been done. 
  The objective of this paper is to develop a system which can analyze the image and predict the expression of the person. 
  The study proves that this procedure is workable and produces valid results.

**Used Components:**
  The work has been implemented using Python (2.7), Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and NumPy.
